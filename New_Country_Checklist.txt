Enabling New Countries

In ArcGIS Pro, connect to ToolData.gdb and open the 'Urban' file. 
	Edit the polygons to cover any areas you know are covered by municipal water delivery.
	Compare to population density raster to make sure all urban centers are covered.
	
Run the "Update Urban Population" tool in the Utility toolset.

Run the "Service Overview tool" for the country and compare results to common sense. Try this using country name and country code.

For each administrative area, run the "Find New Locations" tool and compare results to common sense.
	If you get a ____Error for any region check what region is called in the WPDx database. 
	Connect to ToolData.gdb, and change any incorrect names in the 'Admin' file.
