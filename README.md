# WPDx Toolset

Tools for working with the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx), a global platform for sharing data on water distribution points in the developing world

By establishing a platform for sharing water point data throughout the global water sector, WPDx will add value to the data already being collected. Through bringing together diverse data sets, the water sector can establish an unprecedented understanding of water services. Sharing this data has the potential to improve water access for millions of people as a result of better information available to governments, service providers, researchers, NGOs, and others.
